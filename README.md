# bash
general-virtual-ips-script was something I used to create an isolated (internal to the test server) 200 IP network<br>
It allowed for the mechanics of connecting to IP Addresses to be tested for speed and efficiency. This allowed for<br>
performing network like tests without having to use real network hardware and not having access to hypervisors at the time.<br>
get-int-extip-addresses is useful. I keep forgetting how to command like check external IIP of a machine. This solves that.<br>
yad-sysconfig.sh needs to have yad installed before use. Unlike dialog or whiptail, yad leverages GTK toolkit for a GUI interface<br> 
so you can use it as a wrapper to then execute your scripts or share information.<br>
